                    Manhattan is divided between streets and avenues for the most part. Avenues run north + south while streets run east to west. If the street numbers are increasing, you are traveling north. Likewise, if the avenues are increasing, you are traveling west.<br><br>
                    When using the subway system, there are usually 2 entry points - for uptown or downtown. If you need to travel north from your current location then you must follow signs for uptown. If you need to travel south from your current location then you must follow signs for downtown. If you have an MTA (subway) pass based on dollar amount (yes, you will have based on $ amount) then your pass can also be used on buses. Buses are convenient because they only run on straight paths, they rarely make turns. I realize this information may not be completely necessary but I have found it extremely helpful.

        			A lot of places only take cash, including Thompkins Square Bagels and McSorely's. For the Comedy Cellar, there is a $17 cover charge and each person must order 2 things from the menu (all of it paid at the end of the show). The show is about 1 to 1.5 hours.
